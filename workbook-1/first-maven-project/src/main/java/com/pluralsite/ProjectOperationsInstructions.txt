Create a class named PracticeOperations that creates three variables of type String and concatenated them into one String. It also declares three doubles and then assigns the result of adding, subtracting, and multiplying those doubles to a third variable of type double. Also assign the values of the first double divided by the second double and then the result of that divided by the third double. Create another double variable that holds the accumulation of that result variable added to 10, 100 and 1000.
